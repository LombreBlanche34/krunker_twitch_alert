# üé• Krunker Twitch Alert

This project is a real-time Twitch chat monitoring bot with a web interface for viewing and managing alerts. It detects sensitive keywords, logs chat messages to a database, and sends alert notifications to Discord.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Automatically connects to the chat of streamers currently live in a specific Twitch category (`Krunker` by default).
- Detects messages containing predefined keywords.
- Sends styled alerts via Discord Webhook.
- Web interface (Flask) to:
  - View recent messages.
  - Search by message content, streamer, sender, or date.
  - Add or remove alert keywords.
  - Display activity charts (most active streamers or senders).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The first 10 minutes of a stream are not considered as stopped because Twitch's API frequently produces false positives during this period, repeatedly reporting streamers as offline or online.
